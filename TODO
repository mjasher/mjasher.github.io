From ESRI: 
Spatial analysis lets us ask, and find answers to, a wide range of questions that fall into six broad categories:
    Understanding where things are or where events occur
    Measuring sizes, shapes, and distributions of things or measurements
    Analyzing relationships and interactions between places
    Optimizing locations for facilities, or routes for transportation
    Detecting and quantifying patterns and relationships between things or measurements
    Making predictions based on existing or theoretical patterns and relationships
